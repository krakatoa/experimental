Experimental projects just for learning cool things :)
=============-==_+-===-=_-==========================

To download a project, use the following bash command by replacing the PROJECT with a repo subfolder,

curl -L https://raw.github.com/krakatoa/experimental/master/bootstrap.sh | bash -s PROJECT

So for example, use the following to download the "c/cpu_info" project:

curl -L https://raw.github.com/krakatoa/experimental/master/bootstrap.sh | bash -s c/cpu_info

:)
